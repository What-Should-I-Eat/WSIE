Quick Start with Mocha
----------------------

Assuming you have a coffeescript project with tests cases stored in /test, and you are using
mocha to run your unit tests, `cd` to your project and run:

    npm install --save-dev coffee-coverage istanbul
    mocha --recursive \
          --compilers coffee:coffeescript/register \
          --require coffee-coverage/register-istanbul \
          test
    ./node_modules/.bin/istanbul report

You should now have a coverage report in ./coverage/lcov-report/index.html.

This should work for the majority of projects, but if it doesn't quite do what you want, you can
tweak a few things with environment variables, or you can set up
[custom options with a loader](#writing-a-custom-loader).

You can control how `coffee-coverage/register-istanbul` will work with the following environment
variables:

* `COFFEECOV_OUT` - (defaults to 'coverage/coverage-coffee.json') location to write coverage JSON
  report when your process exits.
* `COFFEECOV_INIT_ALL` - (defaults to 'true') if set to 'true', then coffee-coverage will
  recursively walk through the current folder looking for .coffee files at startup, so you will see
  0% coverage for files that are never loaded.  coffee-coverage will ignore the './test',
  './node_modules', and './.git' folders.  If you want to ignore other folders, see
  [#how to write a custom loader](#writing-a-custom-loader).


Mixed JS and Coffee Projects
============================

Assuming you have a project with a mix of .js and .coffee files in /src, and compiled code in /lib,
and your tests are set up to load code from /src, then run:

    npm install --save-dev coffee-coverage
    npm install --save-dev istanbul
    ./node_modules/.bin/istanbul cover -x 'lib/**' ./node_modules/.bin/_mocha -- \
        --compilers coffee:coffeescript/register \
        --require coffee-coverage/register-istanbul \
        --recursive \
        test

The `-x 'lib/**'` tells Istanbul to ignore the compiled code in /lib.  Also note we're running
`_mocha` here instead of `mocha`, as Istanbul has problems with `mocha`.

Run with NPM
============

Save your mocha options in `/test/mocha.opts`:

    --compilers coffee:coffeescript/register
    --require coffee-coverage/register-istanbul
    --recursive

In package.json, add:

    "scripts": {
        "test": "mocha && istanbul report text-summary lcov"
    }

now you can run `npm test` to run your tests and generate a coverage report.

Writing a Custom Loader
=======================

If the defaults in `coffee-coverage/register-istanbul` don't work for you, you can write a custom
loader.  Save this in "coffee-coverage-loader.js":

    var path = require('path');
    var coffeeCoverage = require('coffee-coverage');
    var projectRoot = path.resolve(__dirname, "../..");
    var coverageVar = coffeeCoverage.findIstanbulVariable();
    // Only write a coverage report if we're not running inside of Istanbul.
    var writeOnExit = (coverageVar == null) ? (projectRoot + '/coverage/coverage-coffee.json') : null;

    coffeeCoverage.register({
        instrumentor: 'istanbul',
        basePath: projectRoot,
        exclude: ['/test', '/node_modules', '/.git'],
        coverageVar: coverageVar,
        writeOnExit: writeOnExit,
        initAll: true
    });

Then when you run mocha, use `--require ./coffee-coverage-loader.js`.
